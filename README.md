### About

I'm Kath, a research assistant at the LSHTM in London. I work in the [epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) group, which focuses on developing tools for the real-time analysis of epidemics. We are based in the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases). 

Currently I mostly work on collaborative modelling - collecting, combining and evaluating the projections of multiple independent models. This mostly comes about from working on the development of the European [Forecast](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) and [Scenario](https://covid19scenariohub.eu/) Hubs. Before that, I worked on supporting the emergency response to COVID-19, mostly in the UK.

In general I am interested in uncertainty and decision making using quantified projections of the future. I am also generally enthusiastic about the history and philosophy of science. I took a slightly unexpected route into studying epidemiology from geography via working at the Wellcome Trust.

### Recent work

A few favourite pieces that I've worked on lately are:
- a [discussion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.12.544667v1) of the experiences of modellers working on the UK COVID-19 response, and the need for better structures and processes of scientific advice in emergency situations
- a [talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c42Lj_6EBD25YdLRGbVKI2DuhmONhAk791Gs--8Daxc/edit#slide=id.g196fd35e525_2_25) looking back over the European COVID-19 Modelling Hubs
- a [grant application](docs/covid19-response-fund-app.md) that was mostly a fun rant about the big collaborative infrastructure projects we've set up in infectious disease, what IMHO I think we should be thinking about, and the potential to borrow ideas about them from other sciences. (Update: it got funded, yay)

More formally, I recently had to write a bit about myself in the course of applying for various things, so I am sticking it on here without edits.
