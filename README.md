### About

I'm Kath, a research fellow at the LSHTM in London. I work in the [epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) group, based in the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases). 

I focus on collaborative modelling - collecting, combining and evaluating the projections of multiple independent models - for the real-time analysis of epidemics. For the last couple of years, I worked on the development and evaluation of the European COVID-19 [Forecast](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) and [Scenario](https://covid19scenariohub.eu/) Hubs. Before that, I worked on supporting the UK's emergency response to COVID-19. 

I previously training in epidemiology and spent some time working on dengue fever. 

In general I'm interested in model evaluation and public health decision making. I'm also keen on talking about (and mostly end up [tweeting](https://twitter.com/kathsherratt) about) the structures and processes of modern academic work.

### Recent work

A few favourite pieces that I've worked on lately are:
- a [discussion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.12.544667v1) of the experiences of modellers working on the UK COVID-19 response, and the need for better structures and processes of scientific advice in emergency situations
- a [talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c42Lj_6EBD25YdLRGbVKI2DuhmONhAk791Gs--8Daxc/edit#slide=id.g196fd35e525_2_25) looking back over the European COVID-19 Modelling Hubs
- a [grant application](docs/covid19-response-fund-app.md) that was mostly a fun rant about the big collaborative infrastructure projects we've set up in infectious disease, what IMHO I think we should be thinking about, and the potential to borrow ideas about them from other sciences. (Update: it got funded, yay)

More formally, I recently had to write a bit about myself in the course of applying for various things, so I am sticking it on here without edits.
