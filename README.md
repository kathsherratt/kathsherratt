### About

I'm Kath, a research fellow at the LSHTM in London. I work in the [epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) group, based in the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases). 

I focus on collaborative modelling - collecting, combining and evaluating the projections of multiple independent models - for real-time outbreak analysis. I worked on the development and evaluation of the European COVID-19 [Forecast](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) and [Scenario](https://covid19scenariohub.eu/) Hubs, and before that, I worked on supporting the UK's emergency response to COVID-19. I previously training in epidemiology. 

In general I'm interested in model evaluation and public health decision making, and the wider structures and processes of modelling work at the interface of science and policy.

### Recent work

- Most recently, I've submitted a PhD (by prior publication): 
  - [Collaborative outbreak modelling for decision support: evaluating trade-offs from multi-model combination](docs/2024_EPH_PhD_Sherratt_K.pdf)
