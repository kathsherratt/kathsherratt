### About

I'm Kath, a research fellow at the LSHTM in London. I work in the [epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) group, based in the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases). 

I focus on collaborative modelling - collecting, combining and evaluating the projections of multiple independent models - for the real-time analysis of epidemics. For the last couple of years, I've worked on the development and evaluation of the European COVID-19 [Forecast](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) and [Scenario](https://covid19scenariohub.eu/) Hubs. Before that, I worked on supporting the UK's emergency response to COVID-19. I previously training in epidemiology. 

In general I'm interested in model evaluation and public health decision making, and the wider structures and processes of modelling work at the interface of science and policy.

### Recent work

Most recently, I've submitted a PhD (by prior publication): 
- [Collaborative outbreak modelling for decision support: evaluating trade-offs from multi-model combination](docs/2024_EPH_PhD_Sherratt_K.pdf)

A few favourite pieces that I've worked on lately are:
- a [discussion](https://twitter.com/MRC_Outbreak/status/1733064080879919377) and [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.12.544667v1) exploring the experiences of modellers working on the UK COVID-19 response, and the need for better structures and processes of scientific advice in emergency situations
- a [grant application](docs/covid19-response-fund-app.md) looking at the big collaborative infrastructure projects we've set up in infectious disease, what IMHO I think we should be thinking about, and the potential to borrow ideas about them from other sciences

And more formally:
- my [CV](docs/Sherratt-CV.pdf)
- my research narrative, [April 2023](docs/research-narrative.md)
