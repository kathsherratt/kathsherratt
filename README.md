Hi! I'm Kath, a research assistant at the LSHTM in London. I work in the [Epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) team, based in the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases). 

Mostly I work on bringing together modellers working on Covid-19 across Europe, by working in the European [Forecast](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) and [Scenario](https://covid19scenariohub.eu/) hubs. My background is in epidemiology and research funding, and I have a strong interest in collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to public health.
