### About

I'm Kath, a research fellow at the LSHTM in London. I work in the [epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) group, based in the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases). 

In general I'm interested in model evaluation and public health decision making, and the wider structures and processes of modelling work at the interface of science and policy.

I focus on collaborative modelling - collecting, combining and evaluating the projections of multiple independent models - for real-time outbreak analysis. I worked on the development and evaluation of the European COVID-19 [Forecast](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) and [Scenario](https://covid19scenariohub.eu/) Hubs, and before that, I worked on supporting the UK's emergency response to COVID-19. I previously trained in epidemiology.
