Conferences

**SHERRATT K**; Collaborative modelling of the future dynamics of COVID-19: the European Forecasting and Scenario Hubs. European Scientific Conference on Applied Infectious Disease Epidemiology (ESCAIDE), Stockholm (2022) 

**Professional development in research**

I have engaged extensively in building collaborations to support my professional research development. This has included contributing to existing modelling consortia in the UK (including COVID-19 response work for SPI-M) and the United States (working closely in the development of the US COVID-19 Forecast and Scenario Hubs). I developed my role into a pivotal position facilitating new modelling consortia in the European COVID-19 Modelling Hubs, together with my supervisor building a collaboration between the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and over 60 independent research groups. I have adopted a strongly open and participatory approach to building these networks, specifically supporting non-traditional researchers and the public to engage with modelling work and outputs. This has given me extensive exposure to a global network of modellers, and an understanding of the opportunities and challenges of policy- and public-facing modelling work. I have complemented this with attending research conferences, such as ESCAIDE (2022) or a Royal Society workshop focused on policy-oriented forecasting (2023), and work travel to strengthen collaborations with US based colleagues.  
**3 EDUCATION**

**Internal contribution**

In 2024, I co-led the creation, design, and teaching of an LSHTM internal course for staff development: “R for Research”. In addition to overall course design, I specifically developed new material and teaching for a module covering “Introduction to Best Practices”. 

I have contributed teaching and assessment to the MSc modules:

* “Health Data Management”: teaching assistant, final project marking and moderation (2024)  
* “Introduction to R”: seminar lead, teaching assistant (2024)  
* “Extended Epidemiology”: teaching assistant, marker (2023)

I am currently contributing to efforts to convert teaching material into the R language.

**External contribution**

In 2024 I contributed to developing new material, reviewing, and teaching on the short course: “Nowcasting and Forecasting Infectious Disease Dynamics”, European Summer School in Infectious Disease Analysis (Stockholm). I will return to teach on this course in 2025\.

**4 CITIZENSHIP**

**Internal contribution**

School and Faculty activity

* Co-lead, EPH ENABLE grant (2024 – present), £10,000. I and two colleagues successfully applied for Faculty funding to support a comprehensive review of accessibility needs linked to neurodivergence. This included managing an external auditor to identify needs and best practices, and is in the process of merging with LSHTM-wide priorities for diversity and inclusion via contributions to the central EDI committee. I continue to actively engage in and champion support for disability and inclusivity across LSHTM.  
* Independent award: Resource Prize, Centre for Epidemic Preparedness and Response (2023), £500. My work together with two colleagues to develop the European Modelling Hubs during COVID-19 won the Centre for Epidemic Preparedness Resource Prize for developing novel tools for epidemic response. I continue to contribute to the CEPR network, including speaking at events and contributing to student welcome and recruitment to the network. 

Department activity

* Lead, CMMID Neurodiversity Network (2022-present). I started and developed a network for peer support for neurodiversity within CMMID, which became the basis for launching wider EDI activity and grant applications around neurodiversity.  
* Co-lead, CMMID Outbreak Response theme (2024-present). I co-lead the cross-cutting thematic area of outbreak response within the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease  
* Co-lead, CMMID Forecast Journal Club (2023-present). I started and co-lead a monthly journal club focused on forecasting and predictive modelling.
