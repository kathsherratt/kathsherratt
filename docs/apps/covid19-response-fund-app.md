### Supporting policy relevant multi-model efforts for infectious disease outbreak response: what can we learn from weather and climate modelling?

#### Background 
During an outbreak of infectious disease, forecasting and scenario modelling are essential tools for assessing current conditions and evaluating the future. In this context, multi-model collaborations play an increasingly prominent role in both the research and policy environment. I propose to conduct a scoping review of modelling comparison projects in the field of weather and climate modelling as an example of long-running collaboration, with a particular focus on potential lessons to be drawn into infectious disease outbreak response.

Previous multi-model comparison projects in infectious disease have responded to outbreaks of Ebola, dengue fever, and seasonal influenza [1]–[3]. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 prompted the rapid development of multiple large-scale collaborations, with forecasting and scenario comparison projects built to inform policy in the US, Europe, Germany, and the UK [4]–[7]. The rationales given for setting up modelling collaborations have included better predictive performance of forecasts, reaching a consensus among scientists, stronger communication with stakeholders, more opportunities for methodological improvements and scientific exchange, and standardised and centralised communication of model results [2], [12]. 

This has had a substantial impact on the academic and policy environment around using models for outbreak response. Over 60 modelling groups in the US and over 40 groups in Europe contributed to the respective COVID-19 Forecast Hubs [4], [5]; in the UK, the collaboration of modellers with government (SPI-M) has been considered an example of a “best practice” for using science to inform national policy. At an infrastructural level there is continued interest in investing in multi-model collaborations for infectious disease outbreak response, with substantial new funding for modelling research from the Wellcome Trust and the founding of the WHO Pandemic Hub.

Within the field of infectious disease, some prospective guidance for multi-model collaborations exists [1], [8], [9] alongside various evaluations of multi-model ensembles [2], [4], [5], [7], [10]. However, we still lack a firm basis for the process of collaborative comparison projects, with the process of setting up, maintaining, and supporting collaborative projects during COVID-19 largely developed ad hoc. At the same time, although we have already seen a number of benefits from collaborations during COVID-19, it is likely that there are benefits from collaboration that we currently do not know how to either articulate or evaluate. For example, substantial questions remain around the infrastructure, evaluation, and communication of modelling collaborations (table 1). This makes it difficult to present the strongest possible case for further funding for existing collaborations, and leaves future collaborations without a clear set of best practices to draw upon.

##### Infrastructure
- What is the most appropriate infrastructure for facilitating collaboration?
- What is the type and scale of resources required to implement this in the short and long term, and in particular outside periods of acute outbreak response funding? 

##### Evaluation
- How might we evaluate collaborations to model the future, moving beyond existing frameworks designed to evaluate single models (i.e. predictive accuracy)? 
- Should the aims and evaluation of a modelling collaboration vary between forecast and scenario modelling, and if so to what degree and in what ways? 

##### Communication	
- How can a collaboration present a coherent consensus of evidence, and communicate uncertainty within and between multiple models? 
- Do collaborations have a role in interpreting the policy implications of a scientific consensus, and if so, how is this considered and communicated?

The aim of the proposed work is not to answer these questions, but to explore how these questions and others have been posed, answered, or remain open in weather and climate modelling, fields that have conducted collaborations for longer, at larger scale, and with substantial policy influence. Weather and climate modelling are fields with analogous characteristics to infectious disease modelling: hazards emerging from complex coupled natural-social systems are matched by the established use of modelling to project future dynamics and impacts, with a high level of technical specialisation required to produce and interpret each model. Previous work has compared best practices across weather, climate, and infectious disease projections, identifying shared needs including a focus on decision support; communicating uncertainty; and capturing vulnerability [11]. 

In each field, the scientific community has started to address these needs by building multi-model comparison and ensemble projects. Collaborative projects create a medium for communication with decision makers, a broader comparison of uncertainty within and between models, and surface a diversity of modelling methods and approaches. For example, collaborations for climate projections emerged over twenty years ago with the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison and later the World Climate Research Programme [13]. Notably, from 2003 the potential for use in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports triggered a coordinated effort from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) to standardise experiments, provide open access datasets, and plan a separate analysis phase for model projections [14]. While collaboration and ensemble methods have become embedded in the practice of climate modelling, this is not without critique: for example, opportunistic model selection, evaluation against observations [15], or unintended structural effects on the field as a whole [16].

#### Aim and objectives
The aim of this work is to gain a broad understanding of what makes collaborations in weather and climate modelling work or fail to work well, in order to transfer this understanding to current practices in collaborative outbreak modelling and better articulate the case for policy relevant multi-model efforts in outbreak response.
Specific objectives are to conduct a scoping review of the history of large-scale, policy relevant collaborative modelling efforts in weather and climate, focussing on infrastructure, evaluation, and communication.

#### Planned activity
I will conduct a scoping review, starting from literature broadly covering the history of collaborative weather and climate modelling. More specifically I will aim to identify critical structures, cultures, resources, and opportunities that have led to the widespread adoption of collaborative comparative work in weather and climate modelling, and key issues in collaborative modelling over time. Framing this work as a scoping review (rather than e.g. a systematic review) allows for a flexible and descriptive approach to such a broadly defined topic [17].
I would necessarily interpret this in the context of differences between climate modelling and outbreak response modelling (e.g. pro/reactive work, timescales, nature of policy interaction), and where best practices already exist, I will explore the extent to which they are field-specific or adaptable to outbreak response.

#### Outcomes
-	A published article discussing the potential for adapting and improving modelling comparison projects for outbreak response
-	Regular sharing of findings with an existing group of researchers (of which I am part) drawn from the US, European, and German Forecast and Scenario Hubs, working on centralising infrastructure for infectious disease Modelling Hubs
-	Using this work to identify gaps in knowledge and practice to form a research agenda around collaborative modelling in infectious disease outbreaks, later applying for further early career researcher funding to pursue these themes.
