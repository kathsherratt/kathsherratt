## Evaluating the comparison and combination of infectious disease models

### Abstract

_Model diversity in real-time response: Evaluating the comparison and combination of infectious disease models_

I review work for the past three years combining and comparing multiple models for the COVID-19 response in the UK and Europe, drawing out cross-cutting themes of the costs and benefits of model diversity in real-time response. We have seen substantial benefits to supporting diversity among models, including efficient detection of real-time dynamics and improved validity when using models in decision support. Yet we should also recognise the costs of multi-model projects, including the potential for information loss and the need for sustainable infrastructure at both project and institutional levels. This analysis is framed in the wider context of collaborative modelling projects, including challenging the explanatory ability and generalisability of past work and ideas for supporting the future development and evaluation of modelling collaborations. 

### Proposal for a critical commentary

During an outbreak of infectious disease, forecasting and scenario modelling are essential tools for assessing current conditions and evaluating options for future action. Multi-model collaborations have played a prominent role in the research and policy environments of the COVID-19 response, particularly in the UK, Europe, and the US. This is based on the idea that models of infectious disease have greater power when combined and compared than taken alone. However, there is little context or critical evaluation of model comparison and combination in infectious disease response. This analytic commentary proposes to fill this gap.

In my work, I have shown the advantages of comparison for outbreak detection, where comparing model results gives unique information about population dynamics [1] or a pathogen’s generation time [2]. Further, my work has shown the emergent properties of combining models into ensembles, including greater predictive accuracy [3]; while appropriately comparing model results can yield more policy-relevant and accurate representations of epidemic wave shapes [4].

However, I have also shown the challenges of model comparison and combination, including the loss of policy-relevant information. Among a diversity of modelling methods, combining model representations may be inappropriate for showing transmission within vulnerable populations [1], key epidemic characteristics [4], or accurate forecasts in certain epidemic phases [5]. I have also explored some of the difficulties of realising collaborations, including unsustainable work practices [6], and significant infrastructure [7].

To contextualise this work, I will explore evaluations of similar collaborative and comparative modelling in both previous epidemic responses, and other fields of policy-relevant research such as weather and climate modelling. Previously, multi-model comparative projects have responded to outbreaks of Ebola, dengue fever, and seasonal influenza [8-10]. These efforts informed multiple large-scale collaborations to support the COVID-19 response in the US, Europe, Germany, and the UK. Meanwhile, there is some guidance for multi-model collaborations in infectious disease [11] alongside various evaluations of multi-model ensembles [12-14].

At the same time, similar questions facing collaborative work have been posed in fields that have conducted collaborations for longer, at larger scale, and with substantial policy influence. Weather and climate modelling are fields with analogous characteristics to infectious disease modelling [15], and collaborations for climate projections emerged over twenty years ago with ensemble methods becoming embedded in the practice of climate modelling [16]. However, this is not without criticism, including opportunistic model selection, inappropriate evaluation against observations, or the unintended structural effects of large-scale collaborations on the field as a whole [17]. The practice of model comparison and combination has been more widely explored in other fields and it will be useful to draw from this in contextualising the benefits and limitations of my work in infectious disease modelling.

A fundamental issue across my work is that of comparing varying assumptions about infectious disease transmission and, critically, its representation in real-time data. For example, surveillance data can see substantial revisions in real-time reporting of surveillance data, creating issues for evaluating forecasting models which may or may not intend to represent the inaccurate real-time data. Similarly, it may be inappropriate to compare model output where the data used to create each model is widely uncertain. For example, comparing estimates of the reproduction number is heavily dependent on using an accurate model of delays between infection and observation in healthcare records, where data on these delays is of different quality for different points in the observable process from case report, hospitalisation, or at death. This use of differentially biased real-time data to comparatively evaluate across models has introduced a variety of issues which have affected findings across my work.

A further limitation throughout my work is that these efforts are targeted at the COVID-19 response, offering little insight into the advantages and disadvantages of modelling comparisons and combinations across settings. For example, the high profile and impact of the pandemic attracted a uniquely large amount of resources in terms of research capital and labour, effectively increasing the sample size of both data and models. However, there was no systematic method for sampling among models before comparing/combining them, and results may be influenced by overrepresentation of certain model types. Furthermore, future infectious disease outbreaks may be unlikely to see this scale and diversity of data sources and models. To address this I will compare conclusions drawn from my work to that of model comparison and combination in contexts with different resources, such as the responses to Ebola, dengue, or Mpox outbreaks.

This work has important implications for the understanding and practice of infectious disease modelling. Implications of adopting a comparison/combination approach might include exploring comparative evaluation against different baseline models, for example whether this should represent a standard linear model or the exponential growth expected of infectious disease. We also need to further understand the properties of ensembles and the components that contribute to their performance, for example selecting models based on diversity/similarity, or the scale dependence of ensemble behaviour. There is also substantial further work to address the disadvantages of comparisons. This could include evaluating the methods and infrastructure for collecting and summarising model results, and strategies for handling the challenges of communicating and presenting results from multiple models.

There is now substantial funding for multi-model collaborations from the US Centre for Disease Control, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the Wellcome Trust, and the World Health Organisation. However, we lack a firm basis for model comparison and combination work and it is likely that there are both advantages and disadvantages that we are currently unaware of. This portfolio draws together work exploring the benefits and limitations of comparative modelling during the COVID-19 response in the UK and Europe, and the proposed synthesis will critically analyse and contextualise this work.

The effective reproduction number (Rt) was widely used in UK public COVID-19 discourse to summarise infectious disease transmission levels. While producing these for SPI-M, our team saw that Rt varied depending on the data source used to estimate it (counts of cases, hospitalisations, or deaths). We suspected that each source sampled from differing subpopulations, so that different Rt estimates give insight into how transmission dynamics vary between them. This was relevant to UK policy, e.g. in allocating resources for COVID-19 testing. We presented this work at SPI-M, then considered by SAGE. I led work as co-first author, jointly developing code and text for SPI-M submissions and independently developing code and text for publication.

This paper represents the efforts of all researchers who participated in the European forecast hub. We report on predictive performance for COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe over 2021, including 29 forecast models for 32 countries. An ensemble had a consistent strong performance across countries over time, demonstrating and supporting the usefulness of multi-model collaboration projects. I led this work as first author, including developing the analysis plan and drafting all code and text.

We aimed to understand information loss when collecting aggregated results from multiple models. Modellers often summarise results into probabilistic quantiles, losing the time-dependence of each model simulation. We compared collecting results as quantiles against a subsample of each model's simulations. Working with simulations we calculate additional epidemic characteristics, gain a better view of uncertainty between models, and evaluate projections against observed data. I led this work as first author, including developing the analysis plan and drafting all code and text. This work is under review prior to submission to a commissioned special edition of Epidemics.

Sherratt, K., and others, 2023. Methodological factors in forecast performance: the influence of model structure and target specificity on the performance of real time COVID-19 forecasts. Working paper, pre-submission to medRXiv and eLife
Performance of forecasts in capturing observed data varies in time and space with no overall "best" forecast. Two features of forecasting methods include the model structure; and the adaptability of each model to each specific forecast target. We investigate forecasts of weekly incident deaths for 32 countries submitted to the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub between March 2021 and March 2023. We categorise models by their structure and specificity, and evaluate forecasts by predictive accuracy. I am leading this work as first author, including developing the analysis plan and drafting all code and text. This work is currently in progress with a preprint delivery in July 2023 and submission to target journal eLife.

The experiences of the modelling community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted substantial challenges in our field, including psychological pressures, gaps in institutional support, and systemic issues that pervade the academic and research landscape. Motivated by these challenges and committed to improving future response efforts, we, a group of 27 members from the UK infectious disease modelling community, convened for a reflective workshop in March 2023. We provide recommendations for improving the practice of modelling in future epidemic response. This paper is confidential while it is considered by eLife editors.

COVID-19 emphasised localised decision making in public health. However, subnational datasets were often only available in originating countries’ languages and required highly customised methods for data management, impeding wider use. We built an R package to access real-time subnational data for 15+ countries, such as Brazil, India, or the USA, with an interface to global data maintained elsewhere. I was a lead developer, including: data sourcing and harmonisation with continuous integration, unit testing, package development, community building users and developers.

We explained the fast spread of the Omicron variant as plausibly due to a shorter generation time (time from being infected to infecting others), by estimating its growth rate and comparing to the dominant Delta variant. This was a key piece of evidence for estimating risk from the variant early in its UK emergence, and was discussed at SPI-M over December 2021-January 2022. I contributed code and initial analysis.


### Personal statement

My work has centred around the development of large-scale collaborations in infectious disease modelling, and I aim to formalise this into a PhD by publication. I have worked on the methodological development of comparing and combining infectious disease forecast and scenario models, while at the same time building collaborations at the research-policy interface. I intend to continue working in modelling infectious disease with a focus on policy-oriented collaborations during outbreak response. I believe aggregating my work into a formal research degree will enable me to put my existing work in context before allowing me to continue to progress in this field.

I believe my work has demonstrated and exceeded the research degree level. Prior to my current position as a research assistant, I was awarded MRC funding to work on a PhD modelling dengue fever in the Philippines, working within the LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease. I started this in 2019 and in May 2020 I successfully passed a PhD upgrading for this work. However, I interrupted study and later withdrew from the PhD programme in order to work full time on the UK COVID-19 response. With a time limit on withdrawal from the PhD programme, I chose to continue to work on COVID-19 modelling, given the public impact of the response and my increasing interest in the scientific basis for policy-focused collaborative modelling of infectious disease. 

I have pursued this over the last three years, and have built a portfolio of work evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of comparison and combination of infectious disease models. Over 2020, my work on the UK COVID-19 response included evidence submissions to the UK government (via 4 first-author, 18 co-author submissions to SPI-M), and I have recently led work evaluating the experience and effectiveness of the modellers working on the UK response. From 2021, I developed the European COVID-19 Forecast and Scenario Modelling Hubs (the latter as co-Investigator). Working directly with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, this project created a platform for collating, combining, and evaluating weekly real-time forecasts of COVID-19 outcomes across 32 European countries from over 40 research teams. In addition to building the software for these Hubs, I have led the scientific evaluation of this work.

In recognition of this work I was recently awarded an individual grant under the LSHTM COVID-19 Response Fund. The grant funds three months’ independent research, where I propose to review collaborative modelling practices in the environmental sciences as an example of analogous developments in infectious disease modelling. This will further contribute to the proposed PhD synthesis work. 

Over my career, I aim to advance the methodological basis for collaborative modelling projects, while advocating for a more structured route for their implementation in public decision making. There is increasing interest in these projects, with substantial investment from the Wellcome Trust, the US CDC, and the WHO. I believe integrating my experience into a doctoral qualification will set the foundation for a career between infectious disease modelling and public policy.
