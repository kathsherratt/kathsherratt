Science Policy: Improving the Uptake of Research into UK Policy

\# Background  
Although science and research are a cornerstone of the economy and a strategic government priority, many researchers have little experience of engaging with policymakers. The relationship between the civil service, government and parliament, and their respective functions, can seem complex, making it unclear how research informs policy decisions. Meanwhile, policymakers can struggle to engage with research, where policy implications and/or recommendations may be buried behind technical jargon or in highly complex scientific papers.

Our sixth course on this series aims to foster collaboration between researchers and policymakers, breaking down barriers and promoting evidence-based policymaking. Specifically designed for early career researchers, the course focuses on building foundational knowledge and practical skills for engaging with the policymaking process. The programme will focus on how policy is made and shaped in the UK, covering creative aspects of policymaking and provides insight into the capabilities, skills, and outputs delivered by policy professionals.

In addition to its educational content, the course also offers a rare opportunity to network with distinguished policy makers, advocates and researchers. The in-person format ensures that attendees will benefit fully from the discussion workshops, which are integral to the experience.

\#\# Target Audience

This course will provide early career researchers (postgraduate students, post-doctoral fellows, technical staff and early career faculty) with an introduction to policy making and show them how to engage with policymakers, either by their research being used to influence policy or by moving into a career in science policy.

This is a residential course. Therefore, all delegates are requested to attend the meeting in person for the full duration to benefit fully from discussions and interactions with the speakers and other participants.

\# Learning outcomes  
After attending this course, participants will be able to:

* Describe and contrast the basic structure and science policy functions of parliament, government, and the civil service.  
* Follow the science policymaking process and identify key moments for influence.  
* Identify and use the different channels through which scientific evidence can inform policy.  
* Tailor evidence to suit the needs of different types of policymakers.  
* Describe how academies, charities, funders, advocacy groups, trade associations, and press offices can channel the voice of scientists.  
* Recognise tools to communicate research and optimise the impact of scientific evidence on public policymaking.  
* Apply creative approaches to policy development.  
* Analyse the role of communication and people-centred policymaking through media and patient perspectives.  
* Connect with policy professionals and researchers who seek to influence policy.

\# Programme  
The course will start at approximately 12.00 on Monday, 18 August and close at approximately 13.00 on Wednesday, 20 August 2025\.

The programme will include lectures and interactive discussions covering the following topics:

* How does research inform policy?  
* How do policymakers use research?  
* Key players in science policy: perspectives from advocacy organisations  
* Creativity and foresight in policy development  
* Science communication and people-centred policymaking  
* Meet the parliamentarians – panel discussion  
* Group works on a theoretical SIT Committee inquiry (applied learning –  participants simulate an actual policy process).
